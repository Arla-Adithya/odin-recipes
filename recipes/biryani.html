        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
            <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.</li>
            <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.</li>
            <li>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
